Frolic is an open source project (written in Rust) to build customer facing dashboards 10x faster. You can directly connect your database to the project and use ready made APIs to query data and create customer facing dashboards.

You no longer have to write custom APIs for different dashboard components and create/maintain SQL queries for them.

![Web App Reference Architecture-5](https://github.com/arihantparsoya/dashboard-api-layer/assets/15258498/156bdb43-23cf-46d5-a212-9c16f2eab01a)

## Use single API to query data for all your dashboard components

You can use a single API endpoint provided by this project to query data for your dashboard. 

For example: 

```curl
curl --location 'http://localhost/api' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "metrics": [
        {
            "field": "orders.subtotal",
            "aggregate_operator": "count"
        },
        {
            "field": "orders.total",
            "aggregate_operator": "sum"
        }
    ],
    "dimensions": [
        {
            "field":"products.category"
        }
    ]
}
'
```

You can pass the metrics you require in the `metrics` field as an array. The `field` of the metric is written in `<table_name>.<column_name>` format. The `aggregate_operator` can be used to specifiy what operation you want to apply on the specified `<table_name>.<column_name>`. 

The `dimensions` field allows you to categorize the metrics returned by the API. To specify the column by which you want to categorize the `metrics`, use the `field` operator and specify the column name in `<table_name>.<column_name>` format.

The data returned by the API will be a list of array. The array will contain the metric values and the dimension by which they are categorized.

The output of the above request will be as follows:

```json
{
    "data": [
        [
            "5061",
            "446835.9692339897",
            "Widget"
        ],
        [
            "4784",
            "404989.686671257",
            "Gizmo"
        ],
        [
            "4939",
            "429618.7213845253",
            "Gadget"
        ],
        [
            "3975",
            "313761.33664894104",
            "Doohickey"
        ]
    ]
}
```

## Running Project

### 1. Add your MySQL database credentials
Enter your MySQL database credentials in the [.env](https://github.com/arihantparsoya/dashboard-api-layer/blob/prod/app/server/.env) file.

### 2. Run the Project

Use docker to run the database
```
docker-compose up --build
```

You can start using the docker container path to query your data.
