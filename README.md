# Build Your Customer Facing Dashboards 10x Faster

Semantic Layer is an open source platform (written in Rust) to build customer facing dashboards 10x faster. You can directly connect your database to the platform and use ready made APIs to query data and create customer facing dashboards.

You no longer have to write custom APIs for different dashboard components and create/maintain SQL queries for them.

![Web App Reference Architecture-5](https://github.com/arihantparsoya/dashboard-api-layer/assets/15258498/156bdb43-23cf-46d5-a212-9c16f2eab01a)

## Use single API to query data for all your dashboard components

You can use a single API endpoint provided by this project to query data for your dashboard. For example: 

```
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/api' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "metrics": [
        {
        "field": "orders.subtotal",
        "aggregate_operator": "count"
        },
        {
        "field": "orders.total",
        "aggregate_operator": "sum"
        }
    ],
    "dimensions": [
        {
            "field":"products.category"
        }
    ]
}
'
```

The output of the above request will be as follows:

```
{
    "data": [
        [
            "5061",
            "446835.9692339897",
            "Widget"
        ],
        [
            "4784",
            "404989.686671257",
            "Gizmo"
        ],
        [
            "4939",
            "429618.7213845253",
            "Gadget"
        ],
        [
            "3975",
            "313761.33664894104",
            "Doohickey"
        ]
    ]
}
```


## Running Project
